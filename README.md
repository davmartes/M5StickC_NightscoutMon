First test version. Need changes in M5StickC library. IMU must be changed or removed (not needed).<br/><br/>

### M5StickC Nightscout Monitor

M5StickC is smaller brother of M5Stack development kit based on ESP32. It is in a tiny plastic box, equipped with color display, 2 buttons, and internal battery. It can be used to monitor and display something, so I used it to monitor my daughter's glycemia. It is small and cheap solution. For better monitoring with alarms, use bigger M5Stack Nightscout monitor.<br/><br/>


### Buttons

The main button changes the backlight in the 3 steps defined in configuration source file.<br/>
